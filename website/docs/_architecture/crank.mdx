# Crank

Solana has no mechanism to schedule transactions so a Crank is used to jump start the system. Any feed approved by the DAO is free to join an oracle queue’s crank. The Crank is a priority queue of data feed public keys ordered by the feeds next available update time. When cranked, Switchboard will look for any data feeds ready for an update and if successful, reward the user who called it. If no data feed is ready to be updated, the crankers transaction will fail and they could potentially lose their transaction fee. The crank is the scheduler behind the oracles and incentivizes users to help keep the system spinning.

An oracle queue without a crank will need to manually update each aggregator on-command. An oracle queue can have multiple cranks but an aggregator can only be assigned to a single crank.

See [Update Request Flow](./update-request) for how a crank initiates an update request.
