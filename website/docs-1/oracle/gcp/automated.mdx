# Automated Setup

## Setup

The helm-manifests repo contains a bash script to walk through the GCP setup and output the required variables to an env file. This script is provided as a convenience tool, you should understand all of the commands in the script before running. To automate the GCP setup, run the following command:

```bash
./setup-gcloud.sh PROJECTNAME

# ./setup-gcloud.sh Sbv-Devnet-Oracle
```

- `PROJECTNAME` will be the name of your GCP project and must contain no spaces or special characters

The script will walk-through the google cloud setup, create your gcp project, add your oracle keypair as a secret, create a service account and give it access to your keypair, then spin up a kubernetes cluster. The script will periodically prompt you for more information.

## Wrapping Up

Upon completion you will have a file `PROJECTNAME.env` containing:

- PROJECT
- DEFAULT_REGION
- DEFAULT_ZONE
- CLUSTER_NAME
- EXTERNAL_IP
- SECRET_NAME
- GOOGLE_PAYER_SECRET_PATH
- GCP_CONFIG_BUCKET
- SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
- SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64

You will need to manually add:

- CLUSTER
- RPC_URL
- BACKUP_MAINNET_RPC
- ORACLE_KEY
- GRAFANA_HOSTNAME
- GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD
- GRAFANA_TLS_CRT
- GRAFANA_TLS_KEY
